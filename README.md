# Dashboard to generate country profiles in the context of the Universal Periodic Review and the Right to Health
**A live version of the country profiles dashboard is available at:** <https://anuppal.shinyapps.io/UPR_country_profiles/>  

## Background  
The UPR recommendations underlying this dashboard have been downloaded from the Danish Institue for Human Rights' [SDG-Human Rights Data Explorer](https://www.humanrights.dk/sdg-human-rights-data-explorer). Using a keywords-based approach, these recommendations were then automatically classified into various health-related themes.

## Install

Ensure that the `pacman` package is installed on your machine before running any of the scripts:
```
install.packages("pacman")
